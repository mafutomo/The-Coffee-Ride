My Quarter 1 project with The Coffee Ride

#Proposal 1:
The Coffee Ride - A front end shop website for quality coffee 
https://the-coffee-ride-coffee-roasting-co.myshopify.com/

This will be similar to Galvanize Delivers but with more rhobust features
> It will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will store some data in Local Storage through a separate checkout screen. Allow for users to be able to interact with the site by selecting items they would like to purchas. It will implement the Stripe API to take in credit card information
