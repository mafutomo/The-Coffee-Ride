# the_coffee_ride
My Quarter 1 project with The Coffee Ride

#Proposal 1:
The Coffee Ride - A front end shop website for quality coffee 
https://the-coffee-ride-coffee-roasting-co.myshopify.com/

This project will be similar to Galvanize Delivers but with more rhobust features.

> It will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will store data in Local Storage with a separate checkout screen to keep track of what the user selects. It will implement the Stripe API to take in credit card information and coordinate the "checkout" process.
