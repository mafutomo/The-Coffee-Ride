It will implement the Stripe API to take in credit card information and coordinate the "checkout" process.

# What problem or need does your project solve?
> This project solves the need to order coffee and coffee subscription online in an efficient, easy, and trustworthy manner.
# Who would be a user of your website?

#Alternate proposal:
Grocery Deals based on location - A frontend website allowing users to search for the best grocery deals based on current location.

> This project will use the Supermarket API to search for grocery deals based on a user's current area. Users can log thier favorite deals in a separate screen (which will incorporate Local Storage).
