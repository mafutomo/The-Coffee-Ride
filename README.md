# the_coffee_ride
My Quarter 1 Project proposal:

#Primary Proposal:
The Coffee Ride - A frontend website allowing users to show for quality coffee. 
https://the-coffee-ride-coffee-roasting-co.myshopify.com/

This project will be similar to Galvanize Delivers but with more rhobust features.

> It will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will store data in Local Storage with a separate checkout screen to keep track of what the user selects. It will implement the Stripe API to take in credit card information and coordinate the "checkout" process.


#Alternate proposal:
Grocery Deals based on location - A frontend website allowing users to search for the best grocery deals based on current location.

> This project will use the Supermarket API to search for grocery deals based on a user's current area. Users can log thier favorite deals in a separate screen (which will incorporate Local Storage).
